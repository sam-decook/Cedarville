Requirements: Restate the problem specification in your own words.
Translate from C to C++ program code that demonstrates a solution to the producer-consumer problem.


Design: How did you attack the problem? What choices did you make and why?
I just used the libraries provided to create the same functionality in C++.


Security Analysis: State the potential security vulnerabilities of your design.  How could these vulnerabilities be exploited and what would be the impact?  
I don't see that I have created any additional security vulnerabilities with my design.


Implementation: Outline any interesting implementations details in your solution.
For the wait conditions, I created a new variable ind, so I could check if the buffer was full or empty. I also didn't overwrite the buffer.


Testing: Explain how you tested your program, enumerating the tests if possible. Explain why your test set was sufficient to believe the software is working properly.
I ran it and made sure that the letters went on and came off in the right order and were random. It matched the example code provided.


Summary: Present your results. Did it work properly? Are there any limitations?
The program works properly.


Lessons Learned: List any lessons learned. What might have you done differently if you were going to solve this problem again?
I spent too much time copying the code over to my editor. This project didn't take very long and so I didn't need to do that.
