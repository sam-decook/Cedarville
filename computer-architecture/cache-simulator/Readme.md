Cache Simulator Project

Instructions for testing:
 - This is mostly self-explanatory. You enter the address in decimal format and you get the data when it is already in the cache (so you would need to enter '0' twice to get '92'). To quit, enter 'q'
 - I don't display the memory already given
 - I only display the cache when it is updated, not when there is a hit, so if you get a lot of hits in a row, you might need to scroll up to see what is stored in the cache

To compile, just run gcc main.cpp and then run the executable.
